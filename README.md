# FuelLogbook in SwiftUI

This is a project I started because I got tired of loosing a pen to write up my travel logs. Struggling to figure out the workings of React Native I ventured into Swift, not any better but
I got a semi working project, ready to built it into a fully featured app. Best practices was probably not followed due to no prior experience and will revert back as more knowledge has
been optained


## Backend
The Backend is currenly hosted on my own severs, custom built FastAPI application
